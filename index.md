## **Research Experience**

### **Project 1: Reaching-and-grasping Planning for Dexterous Hand** `Octorber 2020 - January 2022` <br>
Advised by Prof. Ruizhen Hu, Prof. Hui Huang, Prof. Kai Xu `Visual Computing Research Center, Shenzhen University`<br>
_Project Leader_ <br>
* introduced a novel geometric state representation to characterize hand-object interactions for grasping.
* designed and implemented a novel reinforcement learning approach that can utilize vectorized reward functions and imperfect demonstrations.
* built the physics-based grasp simulation system.

### **Project 2: Online 3D Bin Packing Problem** `August 2019 - October 2020`<br>
Advised by Prof. Chenyang Zhu, Prof. Ying Yang, Prof. Kai Xu `iGRAPE Lab, National University of Defense Technology` <br>
_Project Co-Leader_ <br>
* designed and implemented a RL-based method for online 3D packing task.
* extended the packing method to the looking-ahead setting with the modified Monte Carlo Tree Search method.
* developed a simple user-study app to collected user test data.


## **Publications**
* indicates equal contribution
### **Learning High-DOF Reaching-and-Grasping via Dynamic Representation of Gripper-Object Interaction** <br>
**Qijin She\***, Ruizhen Hu*, Juzhan Xu, Min Liu, Kai Xu, Hui Huang. <br>
#### _ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH’ 22)._
* Proposed a novel geometric representation that dynamically characterizes spatial relation of the hand and the object, as well as a learning method
to train a policy model using the representation to solve the High-DOF reaching-and-grasping task.

### **Online 3D Bin Packing with Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning** <br>
Hang Zhao*, **Qijin She\***, Chenyang Zhu, Ying Yang, Kai Xu. <br>
#### _In Processings of the 35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2021)._ 
* Proposed a new constrained reinforcement learning method with modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to solve the online 3D bin packing problem where only the first k items are known and in a fixed order.
